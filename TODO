Tooling
-------
- zF equivalents for the following:
  - retro-describe (RETRO)
  - retro-document (RETRO)
- A visualizer as a debugger!
- Tool to check and generate stack guards for a word

Syntax changes
--------------
- Remove `()` syntax for comments
- Use `$stack<-` instead of `$stack <-`.
- Use `$stack{}` instead of `switch $foo [[ ]]`
- Use `[| a b c |]` for arrays
- Change variable syntax to (see builtin list)
- Remove unnecessary `is?` and `any` keywords.
- Use new s-expressions syntax (see new-syntax.md)
- Add `table:key` and `:key` shorthand syntax.
- Add doc comments with `\\\ foo`.

Roadmap
-------
- A better name! `zF` isn't very creative.
  - "Bureaucrat" (get it, stack of papers)? "Clerk"?
- Add infra for builtin macros.
- Add `asm` builtin macro.
- Remove builtin words, changing them to asm() words in builtin.zf.
- Refactor parsing code.
  - Remove phony `break`/`continue` instructions.
  - Add location context to AST nodes.
- Slowly change VM instructions to use new zf vm instructions.
- Make syntax changes.
- Eventually, VM rewrite in Zig.
  - Work out extended type system.
    - vm_create_type(VMType {
	name:            *str,
        init_fn:          func,
	index_fn:        ?func,
	cast_fn:         ?func,
	pretty_print_fn: ?func,
	destroy_fn:      ?func,
      })
- Fix stack-name collisions.
- Add misc stdlib functions
- Fix stack guards
- Static analysis on stack usage

Language Features
-----------------
- Enums
  - `enum foo [[ variant1 variant2 variant3 ]]`
  - Accesses with `foo::variant1`
  - `builtin-enum` attribute that allows invocation of invariant without leading
    `namespace:` identifier.
  - Example:
    - `attr(builtin-enum) enum bool [[ true false ]]`
    - `true false`
- `debug` block that only compiles code if in debug mode.
- `while` and `iterate` loop.
- Escape sequences for characters and strings
- Tuples
  - `<x> group` to create tuple.
  - `(| 1 2 3 foo |)` tuple syntax.
  - `(| 1 2 |) :0` or `(| 1 2 |) 0 :` to index.
  - stack shuffling treats tuple as one item.
  - arguments are evaluated immediately.
    - `(| 1 2 3 [foo] |)` to not evaluate immediately.

Builtins
--------
- val(<name>, <type?>)
- var(<name>, <type?>)
- set(<var>)
- attr(<name>, <value?>)
- register-attr(<name>, <value-type>)
- has-attr?(<function>, <name>)
- asm(<flags>, <stack>, <instruction>, <args>)
- wrap(<word>)
  - What was this for? …
  Causes <func> to be called when the TOS is destroyed. Only applicable for
  non-scalar types.
- reflection:function-name(<func>) -> string
  - Used in word `stacktrace`
- reflection:function-source(<func>) -> (| file line col |)
  - Used in word `stacktrace`

Optimizations
-------------
- `dup` with subsequent instruction that can take a non-stack argument
  can be removed.
- Remove `not not`.
- Remove unused calls (i.e., they are pure and generate stack values that
  are `drop`'d without being read or used in any way).
- Tail call optimization (maybe a `recurse` keyword that guarantees tail
  recursion?).
- div/mul => shift+add
- Redo user-done stack-shuffling to minimize picking/rolling values
  deep within the stack.
- Aggressive word inlining, where possible.

Metadata
--------
- `double-call-is-nop`
- `verbatim`
  Don't optimize in any way the following block. (May cause optimizations
  to be dropped from preceding/following blocks as well?)
- `deprecated`       (`<message>`)
- `unavailable`      (`<message>`)
  - Like `deprecated`, but emits an error.
- `impure`/`pure`
- `for`              (`linux`, `windows`, `macos`, `openbsd`, `freebsd`)
- `alias`            (`<name>`)
- `public`
  The word will be exported and will be visible from an `import`'d table.
  (Might not be added -- shouldn't all words be visible unless explicitely
  marked so? "Trust the user"?)
- `test`
- `native-interface`
  The following word declaration refers to a foreign library
  imported over the FFI.
- `impl-detail`
  The following word is considered an "implementation detail" and its use should
  be avoided. Will result in a warning if used outside of that namespace.
  (Will be unnecessary if `public` is added as well)
- `unchecked`/`wild`
  No compile-time or runtime stack analysis is to be done on the following block.
- limit-stack-size   (<stack>, <size>)
  - Only one per program.
  - Limits stack to a maximum size.
- suggest-stack-size (<stack>, <size>)
  - Only one per program.
  - Suggests stack size to allocate at first.
- no-feature         (<feature>)
  - Only one per program.
  - Disables feature.
  - Features: `floats`, `coroutines`
- float-size         (<size>)
  - Only one per program.
  - Sizes: 16, 32, 64, 128
- soft-symbol
  - Marks the following symbol as being overwriteable by an external mod.

Ideas
-----
(~ == obsolete/rejected idea)
- Python-style decorators
  - Maybe just a side-effect of using a non-builtin attribute?
  - Function cache'ing (Python's functools.cache(fn))
- Lexical scoping of variables
  - Would encourage using variables as "escape hatch"...
    - But we should trust the user amirite?
  - Would reduce or destroy factorability if it was overused
- Table templates
- Coroutines
  - If not coroutines: generators?
- Concurrency
  - Would require linear logic -- that is, all values would have to be used
    exactly once.
- Implicit block passing, as in Ruby
- Actual closures, not lambdas (how would that work??)
- Append/prepend symbols to end of word invocation to modify behaviour
  - '!' to immediately pop TOS
    - `read-file!`, which could normally push "data read-size", would now push
      just "data"
      - Alternatively: `!read-file`
  - 'λ' to pass implicit block
    - `1 2 [foo bar baz] do-stuffλ`
      - Alternatively: `1 2 [foo bar baz] λdo-stuff`
- More expressive stack guard syntax (see minlang)
- Matrices instead of vectors
- "argument" keyword that specifies a command-line argument
  - `"foo" argument('f' "foo" true)`
  - Parsed arguments are put in `arguments` global table.
~ Native SIMD?
  - Rejected:
    - Would complicate the underlying VM quite a bit.
    - Anyway, if you care about SIMD, you shouldn't be using a scripting lang.
- Builtin IPC?
- String operators
  - CSV/TOML/YAML/JSON processing
    - j"{'test':'test'}" -> "{'test':'test'}" json:parse
  - String interpolation (Python's f-strings)
    - f"Hello {@1}{@2}{TEST}" -> "Hello {@1}{@2}{TEST}" format
- > Something like a type system, except where you make statements about the code
  > instead of about the values. For example, a possible statement might be "this
  > never allocates memory" or "this is linear time and space on the size of the
  > inputs."
  - From https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/b2a61l/what_are_some_niche_features_youd_like_to_see_in/eirhoef/
~ Something like CL's conditions and restarts
  - Rejected: would require adding exceptions. Gross.
~ Unit annotations
  ~ https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/units-of-measure/
~ `match` block to match against TOS
  - Rejected: would require complex wildcard matching
  - Could be added later
