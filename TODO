Roadmap
=======

x Basic analyzer (keep track of stack count)
x Basic analyzer (keep track of types)
x Memory opcodes
x Devices (same as enums?)
x String literals
x Variables
x If statement
x Structs
x HERE
- Malloc
  x Basic + free + realloc
  x Defrag
  - Opaque ("void") pointers
  x Maybe0
  - Unit tests, stress tests
x Remove macros
x Test suite
x Imports
- Vec
  - Unbounded
- Enums
- Shadowcaster
- Refactoring
  - Scopes
  - Explicit main function
  - Decls within decls

- Static analysis pt 2
  - New analyser pass: track comptime-known vals
  - Devices
    - Chk: is port readable/writeable when calling deo/dei

Optimizations
-------------

- Eliminate duplicate decls (from generics)
  - E.g. 0 1 swap and 0 (as ptr) 1 (as ptr) swap -> two different functions,
    which is unnecessary (only one needs to be generated)
  - Solution: after spouting out decl at codegen time, check if the generated
    output is exactly the same as another variant, and delete if that's the
    case (and set romloc to that other function's romloc)
    - Change variants field of decl to ASTNodePtrList to make this easy
- Auto-inlining
  - Metadata: always/never inline
- Tail recursion
  - (recurse) builtin
